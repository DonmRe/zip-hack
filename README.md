# Zip Hack App

Quick link to [backend](https://github.com/gnordhielm/zip-hack-backend).

We are creating an application for job seekers who are managing bifurcated professional lives: career changers, freelancers looking for full-time work, etc. It is a time management and information organization tool meant to help people achieve concrete goals - and not resign themselves to an idle or fruitless job search.

This app was built by [Steven](https://github.com/srpeltz), [Alex](https://github.com/DonmRe), [Marina](https://github.com/mlupin), and [Gus](https://github.com/gnordhielm).

## Minimum Viable Product

Has...

* A visual interface for tracking applications (resume version, dates, status of application, cover letters, job post link, company name, contacts at company)
* A visual interface for tracking freelance jobs (client user(s), developer user, project name, array of 'milestones' (date, text, completion status), payment status).

## Stretch Goals

* Allow multiple developers to use one project tracker.
